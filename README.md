mythtv-monitor is used to monitor and handle System Events from MythTV.

TODO:
 - Only worry about system events we care about.
 - Lookup program names where possible (i.e. for recording started, finished, etc)
 - Perhaps add zabbix items to the tuners and log when they are being used for recordings.
